THE GAP ATTRIBUTE
-----------------

Protein and nucleotide alignment features typically consist of two
sequences, the reference sequence and the "target", and are not always
colinear.  For example, consider the following alignment between an
EST ("EST23") and a segment of the genome ("Chr3"):

        Chr3  (reference)  1 CAAGACCTAAACTGGAT-TCCAAT  23
        EST23 (target)     1 CAAGACCT---CTGGATATCCAAT  21

Previous versions of the GFF format would represent this alignment as
three colinear segments, but this made it difficult to reconstruct the
gapped alignment.  GFF3 recommends representing gapped alignments
explicitly with the "Gap" attribute.  The Gap attribute's format
consists of a series of (operation,length) pairs separated by spac
characters, for example "M8 D3 M6".  Each operation is a single-letter
code:

       Code      Operation
       ----      ---------

        M        match
        I        insert a gap into the reference sequence
        D        insert a gap into the target (delete from reference)
        F        frameshift forward in the reference sequence
        R        frameshift reverse in the reference sequence

In the alignment between EST23 and Chr3 shown above, Chr3 is the
reference sequence referred to in the first column of the GFF3 file,
and EST23 is the sequence referred to by the Target attribute.  This
gives a Gap string of "M8 D3 M6 I1 M6". The full GFF match line will
read:

   Chr23 . Match 1 23 . . . ID=Match1;Target=EST23 1 21;Gap=M8 D3 M6 I1 M6
